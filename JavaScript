Learning JavaScript - 
Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
Variables are stored in memory.
The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables
In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.

An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
We can add more conditions using else if statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.
The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
